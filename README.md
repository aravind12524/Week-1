# Week-1

This project employs linear regression to predict solar power output based on key environmental factors such as sunlight, temperature, and cloud cover. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation. The insights derived from this project can significantly enhance energy planning and optimization.
